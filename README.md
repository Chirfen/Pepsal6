# Pepsal6
The IPv6 version PEPsal, adapted from PEPsal-2.0.1.

The original PEPsal was not designed for IPv6 Protocol, and this project aims at adapting it to support IPv6.
The current aim is to build PEPsal for only IPv6, but not for IPv4/IPv6 simultaneously.


The source code of original pepsal-2.0.1 was obtained from "sourceforge.net/projects/pepsal/".
